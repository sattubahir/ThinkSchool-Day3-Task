# VS Code Power Usage: Emmet, Snippets, Debugging

## Overview

This repository demonstrates practical usage of Visual Studio Code features to boost developer productivity through:

- **Emmet abbreviations**: rapid HTML authoring using shorthand syntax.
- **User snippets**: customizable code templates to speed up repetitive coding tasks.
- **JavaScript debugging**: configuring and running JS debug sessions within VS Code.

These exercises improve coding speed, reduce errors, and facilitate debugging workflows.

## Deliverables

### 1. Emmet Practice Gist

- Example Emmet abbreviations with their expanded HTML output.
- Helps understand and practice efficient HTML coding using Emmet.

### 2. User Snippet for HTML Boilerplate

- A user snippet file (`html.json`) that inserts a complete HTML5 boilerplate template.
- Enables fast setup of new HTML documents with editable tab stops.

### 3. VS Code Debug Configuration

- `.vscode/launch.json` containing a simple configuration to launch and debug JavaScript files.
- Supports setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting variables during development.

---

## How to Use

- Open the project in VS Code.
- Practice typing Emmet abbreviations and expanding them to HTML.
- Use the user snippet prefix in `.html` files to insert the boilerplate.
- Use the debug configuration in `.vscode/launch.json` to run and debug JS files.
